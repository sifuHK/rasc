# RASC

The RASC project has introduced supplements and improvements to existing statistical methods, aiming to provide data analysis and modeling practitioners with a more accurate and user-friendly algorithmic framework.

Project Evolution:
Phase 1 (ScoreConflow):
Developed a "business directives + unattended operation" approach for scorecard modeling. The original intent of RASC was to deliver a more precise and labor-efficient scorecard development tool.

Phase 2 (Risk Actuarial ScoreCard):
Built upon the previous phase to introduce risk actuarial scorecards. This stage comprehensively considers user default risk, profitability levels, and data costs in model construction.

Phase 3 (Risk Actuarial Statistics):
Expanded beyond scorecard development to address gaps in statistics and machine learning for practical risk quantification. Enhanced with:  
  Automated XGB hyperparameter tuning  
  High-dimensional stratified sampling  
  Mixed-data-type imputation  
  Reject inference
